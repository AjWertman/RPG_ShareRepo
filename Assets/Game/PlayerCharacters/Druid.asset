  summaryText: charName was born and raised in the Red Forest by tree spirits, although
    no one knows how she first arrived there. The Red Forest is known for its aggressive
    and violent inhabitants and it is rumored that a group of beasts massacred a
    local village and kidnapped her, she was then saved by the tree spirits. Growing
    up in the Red Forest taught charName to defend herself, however, she prefers
    to reverse the effects of violence and heal living creatures.
